This package contains the lib files, ERRATA.md, LICENSE, README.md & SECURITY.md from the 1.1.5 release of random_compat @ https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat/releases/tag/1.1.5

The following directories / files were removed as they are not required for vB and the creators of random_compat did not request that maintain them :
-----------------------
tests
tests/*
.gitignore
.scrutinizer.yml
.travis.yml
composer.json
phpunit.sh
phpunit.xml.dist
-----------------------

Note, I am including SECURITY.md out of consideration for the project owners (Paragon Initiative), but is not functionally required.

I am including ERRATA.md as a handy list of random sources that the lib requires.
